## Hey There, Welcome to My World

I'm Ilyas, a 24-year-old tech enthusiast from Norway, currently diving into the depths of Optimization for my Master's at the University of Bergen. But hey, this isn't just about academia. I'm here to chat about my adventures in coding, my love for learning, and the quirky sides of being a tech student and beyond. Stick around for stories, insights, and maybe a few coding tips along the way.

## A Little More About Me

Born and bred in Norway, I've been on this tech journey pretty much since I could type. I wrapped up my Bachelor's in Computer Technology at UiB, which was a blast of programming, data structures, networking, you name it. From Java to Haskell and Python, I've had my hands in all sorts of coding cookie jars.

### The Early Days

Before I got serious about tech, I was out there in the real world, working as a Store Clerk at Coop Prix LÃ¸keberg, where I learned the arts of customer service and cash handling - and yes, the importance of a well-stocked shelf. I even spent some time as a Kindergarten Assistant at Gommerud Barnehage, which was all about creating fun and educational experiences for the little ones. Who knew that would be the perfect prep for managing coding bugs?

## What I'm Up To

### Mastering Optimization

I'm currently navigating through my Master's in Optimization, diving into algorithms, problem-solving strategies, and everything in between. It's like a puzzle, but the pieces are concepts, and the picture is efficiency. And I'm all in!

### Volunteering and Beyond

I've dipped my toes in various experiences, like volunteering at the Booster Conference in 2022, where I got a taste of the tech community's vibrant spirit. Networking, supporting attendees, and even helping set up the event - it was a whirlwind of learning and connecting.

## Passions and Hobbies

When I'm not coding or buried in textbooks, I'm probably out exploring Norway's beautiful landscapes or trying my hand at something new. Rapid learning isn't just a skill for my resume; it's a lifestyle. From mastering a new programming language to figuring out how to cook something edible, I'm all about the journey.

## Let's Connect

Whether you're into tech, looking for some coding tips, or just want to hear more about my misadventures in learning Haskell, I'd love to hear from you. Technology is about connection, innovation, and, most importantly, people. So let's chat, collaborate, and create something cool.

Thanks for stopping by, and I can't wait to share this journey with you!
