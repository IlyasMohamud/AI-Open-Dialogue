# My Blogging Website

Welcome to my website! It's built with Next.js, starting from a simple template because I was keen on learning how it all works. The project's goal was pretty straightforward: understand Next.js by actually using it and end up with a functioning blog.

What we have here is exactly thatâ€”a place where I can share posts about anything that catches my fancy. It's been an interesting journey learning how to piece everything together.

For the blog posts, I use something called Markdown files. They're pretty easy to use and let me write my posts without worrying too much about formatting.

In essence, this project was about learning through practice. I wanted to see if I could take a basic template and make it into something uniquely mine. The result is this blog, a personal project that taught me a lot about web development with Next.js.
