## The Future of AI: Jobs and Safety

As we stand on the brink of a technological revolution powered by artificial intelligence (AI), the landscape of jobs and workplace safety is poised for significant transformation. While I am not directly involved in AI development, my interest in the field, particularly in AI safety, grows as the technology advances. The implications of AI on jobs are vast and varied, and as someone with aspirations in web development, I see a unique opportunity to bridge my technical skills with my passion for ensuring safe AI practices.

### The Impact of AI on Jobs

AI technology is set to redefine roles across industries, automating tasks that were once thought to require human intuition. While some fear the potential for job displacement, AI also opens up avenues for new job creation, particularly in tech and AI oversight. My goal is not to work directly in AI development but to remain informed and involved in how AI shapes the workforce.

### My Role in AI Safety

AI safety is a crucial aspect of the technology's development that needs more voices and more action. By participating in conventions and events focused on AI safety, I aim to contribute to a global conversation on establishing robust safety protocols and ethical guidelines. These gatherings are vital for sharing knowledge, setting standards, and ensuring that AI advancements do not outpace our ability to manage them safely.

### Bridging Web Development and AI Safety

Starting in web development, I plan to leverage my skills to build platforms that facilitate dialogue and education about AI safety. Creating websites and applications dedicated to AI safety conventions and events will allow me to play an active role in the AI community, even if my primary job function is not AI-centric. It's a unique way to marry my career goals with my commitment to a safe AI-powered future.

### Looking Forward

As the field of AI continues to grow, the importance of safety cannot be overstated. My journey begins with web development, but with a keen eye on how AI and its governance evolve. By staying engaged in AI safety initiatives, I aim to contribute effectively to a field that is not just about technological prowess but also about safeguarding humanity and ethical progress.
