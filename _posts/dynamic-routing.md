## Hi and welcome to my blog page

Welcome! I'm 24, deep into getting my Master's in Informatics at UiB, where I also finished my Bachelor's in Computer Technology. This blog is all about my fascination with machine learning and my journey in web development. It's where I share the highs and lows of diving into new technologies and trying to build cool stuff.

## A Bit About Me

Originally, I got into tech because I loved the idea of creating things that could solve real problems or make life easier in some way. After getting my hands dirty with a few programming languages and projects, I realized machine learning was where my heart truly lies. It's this incredible blend of technology, math, and a bit of magic that has the power to transform industries and even our day-to-day lives.

## Why I Started This Blog

I started this blog because I'm part of the Bergen AI Governing Group, and we're all about making sure AI is safe. I got really interested in how amazing AI can be but also how it can be risky if we're not careful. Here, I want to talk about all the things we're learning about keeping AI under control and safe. This blog is a place where we can chat about how to deal with AI’s big risks and share stories and ideas on making AI better for everyone. Let's figure out this AI adventure together, making sure it’s good for the world.

## What Drives Me

### The Magic of Machine Learning

There's something almost magical about teaching a computer to learn from data and make decisions or predictions. Whether it's improving healthcare, making businesses more efficient, or just creating a smarter app, the potential is endless. I'm constantly experimenting with new models and datasets, and I love the challenge of turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions.

### Building and Experimenting

Apart from machine learning, I'm also really into developing websites and apps. Starting with just an idea and then coding it into existence is super rewarding. I've worked on a few projects, both for fun and for my studies, and each one teaches me something new. I'm all about learning by doing, and I believe the best way to understand something is to try to build it yourself.

## Let's Connect

If you're into tech, curious about machine learning, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to discussing ideas, collaborating on projects, or just chatting about the latest in technology.

Thanks for dropping by, and I hope you stick around!
