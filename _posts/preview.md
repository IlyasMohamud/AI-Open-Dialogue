title: "Closing regulatory gaps through non-proliferation, Week 15"
excerpt: "Navigating the tightrope of AI's promise and peril, we find ourselves at a crossroads: closing regulatory gaps through non-proliferation. But as we tread this path, a lingering question haunts our stepsâ€”should we really place our trust in the U.S. to lead the way? In this discussion, we'll explore the intricate dance of global AI governance and the trust we place in powers steering its course.

## Analysis of AI Chips Governance and Supply Chain Control

### Overview

This document presents a critical analysis of the current state of AI chips production, the global supply chain, and the regulatory landscape. It highlights the significant control exerted by the United States over the AI chip market and the potential biases in public discourse and policy-making towards U.S. dominance.

## AI Chips and Frontier AI

- **Definition**: AI chips are specialized computer chips designed specifically for artificial intelligence applications.
- **Frontier AI**: Represents the most advanced AI technologies available at the present time.
- **Regulatory Considerations**: There's a discussion around whether the production of AI chips should be regulated. This is because, unlike algorithms, AI chips are tangible and thus potentially easier to govern.

## Global Supply Chain Dynamics

- The manufacturing of AI chips involves a complex global supply chain, with a few countries and companies controlling critical steps.
- **Key Players**:
  - **Design**: U.S. companies like NVIDIA and Google dominate.
  - **Manufacturing Equipment**: ASML in the Netherlands, known for its EUV lithography technology.
  - **Fabrication**: TSMC in Taiwan is the leading fabricator of advanced AI chips.
  - **Assembly**: Various countries are involved, with China having a significant market share.
  - **Cloud Providers**: U.S. companies (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) lead in selling AI chip access, holding about 65% of the market share.

## Concerns and Critiques

### Regulatory Intentions

- The proposition that regulating AI chips could foster international cooperation on AI safety is met with skepticism. Critics argue that it might be more about control and financial gain, with leading developers seeking to inhibit others.

### U.S. Dominance

- The United States is perceived to be attempting to slow China's development of frontier AI models.
- The regulatory approach to data, likened to China's policies, raises concerns about surveillance and privacy.
- The U.S. is depicted as having an outsized role in the AI supply chain, leveraging this to restrict exports to China.

### Bias in Discourse

- Some narratives express a strong positive bias towards the U.S.'s role in the AI chip supply chain, overlooking the potential for more balanced global development.
- Videos and articles, including those associated with U.S. policymakers, exhibit this bias, with some content even questioning the quality of STEM PhDs in China.

## Conclusion

The discourse around AI chips governance and the global supply chain is complex, with significant U.S. control and a notable bias in discussions. This analysis calls for a more balanced view that considers the interests and capabilities of all global players in the AI arena.
